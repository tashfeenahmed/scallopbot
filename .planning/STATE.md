## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pass script args as JSON in SKILL_ARGS env var (prevents injection)
- Support .ts, .js, .sh script types with appropriate runners
- 30-second default timeout for script execution
- Bash skill user-invocable: false (agent-only, not slash command)
- 60-second default timeout for bash commands
- 30KB output truncation for bash to prevent memory issues
- Exit code 126 for blocked commands (standard "cannot execute" code)
- SKILL_DIR env var for workspace root, falls back to cwd
- Exit code 124 for timeout (standard Unix convention)
- 5-second grace period between SIGTERM and SIGKILL
- web_search skill uses native fetch() (Node.js 18+)
- user-invocable: true for search skill (slash command enabled)
