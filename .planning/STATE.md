# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Skills-only execution: Every capability the agent has comes from a skill file that advertises itself to the agent.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Agent Loop Refactor

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 8 (Agent Loop Refactor)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-04 — Completed 07-02-PLAN.md

Progress: █████████░ 77%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 26 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 2 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |
| 3 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |
| 4 | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 5 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |
| 6 | 2 | 5 min | 3 min |
| 7 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 2min, 2min, 3min, 2min
- Trend: Stable (~2-3 min/plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pass script args as JSON in SKILL_ARGS env var (prevents injection)
- Support .ts, .js, .sh script types with appropriate runners
- 30-second default timeout for script execution
- Bash skill user-invocable: false (agent-only, not slash command)
- 60-second default timeout for bash commands
- 30KB output truncation for bash to prevent memory issues
- Exit code 126 for blocked commands (standard "cannot execute" code)
- SKILL_DIR env var for workspace root, falls back to cwd
- Exit code 124 for timeout (standard Unix convention)
- 5-second grace period between SIGTERM and SIGKILL
- web_search skill uses native fetch() (Node.js 18+)
- user-invocable: true for search skill (slash command enabled)
- Browser skill wraps existing BrowserSession (wrapper pattern)
- Browser skill user-invocable: true (slash command enabled)
- memory_search defaults to 'fact' type (not raw logs)
- Lazy singleton for MemoryStore/HybridSearch in skill scripts
- TelegramGateway singleton matches BrowserSession pattern
- Gateway wires telegram singleton after channel starts
- Generic skills reference in prompt (skills describe themselves via inputSchema)
- inputSchema optional in frontmatter for backward compatibility
- Skills are primary capability source; tools are fallback during transition
